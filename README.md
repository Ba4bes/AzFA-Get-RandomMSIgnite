# AzFA-Get-RandomMSIgnite

This is a fun little script to give an example for a Azure Function App with PowerShell.

The script gets a random Microsoft Ignite session, using the api provided by the Techcommunity.
It gives you the session info and the option to view the session in the Igniteportal and view the recording.
